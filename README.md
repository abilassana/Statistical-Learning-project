Can we use the y-value of training vector with the smallest distance towards testing vector in Knn regression instead of average of y-values?
This project examines the effectiveness of slight modification which had been implemented to the well-known K-nearest neighborsâ€™ regression. The label value of the neighbor with the shortest Eu-clidian distance towards testing data was used as a prediction. Examination showed that this change is not more effective than usual Knn re-gression
